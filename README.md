# About
This is for personal use and is subject to change (i.e if nexus releases pathing I'll probably swap to that), I don't recommend using as anything other than a reference, there's probably a better way to do this anyway.

Custom Bazzite image to include [kwin BlishHUD shader](https://github.com/FloFri/kwin-blishhud-shader) for Guild Wars 2 and maybe other stuff in the future.

Built from ublue-os/image-template
Use `rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/aarkaus/bazzite-custom:latest` to rebase to this. Only use if already running bazzite-nvidia.
